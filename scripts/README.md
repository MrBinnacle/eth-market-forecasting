# Scripts

Utility scripts for setting up and bootstrapping the project.

- `bootstrap.sh` – checks for Node and installs npm dependencies if missing.
- `setup-env.sh` – installs both Node and Python dependencies in one step.
- `setup-python-env.sh` – creates and activates a Python virtual environment, installing `backend/requirements.txt`.

These scripts are optional helpers. Review them before running and ensure you understand what they do.
